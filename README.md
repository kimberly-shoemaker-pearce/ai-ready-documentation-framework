# AI-Ready Level 4 and 5 Process Documentation Framework  

This framework shows how employees can use **Microsoft Teams**, **Copilot**, and **SharePoint** to capture and manage Level 4 and Level 5 business process documentation.

### Documentation Levels

- **Level 4 — Process Narratives:** describe who performs each activity, what they do, and when it occurs within the workflow.  
- **Level 5 — Work Instructions:** provide detailed, task-by-task guidance that supports the activities defined in the Level 4 narrative.

### Benefits

Maintaining both levels of documentation creates clarity, consistency, and readiness for AI adoption:

- **Employees** gain role clarity through well-written process narratives and achieve task mastery through precise work instructions.  
- **Employers** gain visibility into repeatable processes, enabling them to identify automation opportunities and accelerate AI-driven innovation.
