# AI-Ready Level 4/5 Process Documentation Framework  

The **"Level 4/5 Framework"** provides an easy, repeatable way for every employee to document their work processes using tools already available in their organization’s Microsoft 365 ecosystem:  

- **Microsoft Teams** — to record and capture process knowledge  
- **Copilot** — to draft and structure process narratives and work instructions  
- **SharePoint** — to store and manage finalized documentation  

### Documentation Levels
This framework enables employees to capture the “how” of their daily work and translate it into clear, usable process documentation at process documentation level 4 and Level 5:

- **Level 4 — Process Narratives:** describe who performs each activity, what they do, and when it occurs within the workflow.  
- **Level 5 — Work Instructions:** provide detailed, task-by-task guidance that supports the activities defined in the Level 4 narrative.

### Benefits

Maintaining both levels of documentation creates clarity, consistency, and readiness for AI adoption:

- **Employees** gain role clarity through well-written process narratives and achieve task mastery through precise work instructions.  
- **Employers** gain visibility into repeatable processes, enabling them to identify automation opportunities and accelerate AI-driven innovation.

## Example Processes 
I will create the following level 4 and 5 process documentation:
- [Assigning a Help Desk Ticket – Level 4 Process Narrative](HelpDesk_Level4_ProcessNarrative.md)  
- [Assigning a Help Desk Ticket – Level 5 Work Instructions](HepDesk_Level5_WorkInstructions.md)  
- [Creating Meeting Minutes – Level 4 Process Narrative](MeetingMinutes_Level4_ProcessNarrative.md)  
- [Creating Meeting Minutes – Level 5 Work Instructions](MeetingMinutes_Level5_WorkInstructions.md)
